# 442project

Project: A collaborative Virtual/Augmented Reality space for kids in hospitals to allow them to participate in activites that their illness/disability would prevent. To focus on controls that are agnostic to the phsyical capability of the user so that regardless of their disability, or illness they can participate the same way another user would. Additionally hospitals are very sterile and virtual reality would allow kids to "decorate" to allow them to have a personal space.
